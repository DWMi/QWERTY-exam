Sprint 1:
On this sprint we started to build on our mockup on figma, such as a design for all of our pages and our logo as well.
That took longer time than we expected but we managed to do it in aprox. 3 days.
After that we started to set up our repo on github and started to do our inital setup as well as the file structure in VSC.
As we were done with everything on the first sprint we decided to start a little bit on our components such as the header and the footer. And meanwhile that was done one of us started to look into the database in this case MongoDB and how it would work with an e-commerce if its even possible to do so. Which it was, so we also started to do some testing such as trying to push test products into our database and with sucess we ended the sprint.

Sprint 2:
Now that we had the mockups finished and had made successful testing with the database, it was time to start coding and get to work for real. The focus on sprint two was to code the skeleton for the website and to have the the most fundamental components such as header, footer, navbar, landing page etc implemented on the site. Once the website had a basic layout we then focused on fetching data from the database (products, categories etc..) to display on the diffrent pages. We had some challenges on the way since neither of us hade worked to much towards mongoDB but I think we really helped each other and made the best of it. The other thing that we did during sprint two was to have a working login/register functionality and authentication. To implement this in such a early state of the project was a consious descision from our side. We wanted to be able to conditionally show diffrent content depending on wether the user visting the website was there as "guest" or an actual registered and signed in user. In conclusion the second sprint had a little bit of a starting distance but as a whole definitely was a success with all the issues being completed on time!

Sprint 3:
After the login and register functionalities done, we started with the admin dashboard. We pushed this from sprint 2 to sprint 3 since it had a lot of theoretical questions to be taken care of such as what to authenticate and how to structure the user object.
We found the database for the images and uploaded some as test, then worked on the upload functions and everything worked fairily good, with some fixes here and there for the picture naming process.
We implemented the payment system as well as the checkout page and the product page, it started to become something real at this point, with the payment (Stripe) working correctly and the checkout page rediricting to it.

The admin took a long time since all the functionalities needed to do an API call to the backend and building them was a long process, but fun overall.

With the database connected, the admin page done and the checkout process all working, we started to work more with responsiveness, while searching for a good deployment service, so we could have the website running and publish it.

We ended the srpint by moving the profile page issue to the sprint 4 since we had no time to work on it due to some server issues and the responsiveness.

Sprint 4:
In this sprint we added the cookies page and a functional cookies popup, and updated the FAQ with some questions & answers that will cover most of the terms of purchase and such.
We also did some debugging and fixed some minor security issues and also some responsivness on all pages.
We finished the profile page and it is responsive and all.
We added a functional contact page that sends a message to our gmail.
We uploaded it to Vercel and after a little debugging with the back end side, we finally had the site running on a server.
And with all the things done we finished the coding part of the project which leaded to completion of sprint 4.

Sprint 5:
The last sprint! Final touches and debug were the last things to take care of.
We needed to fix some issues found during the debugging process and write a proper README file so it was easy and more understandable.
We also wrote the report and prepared the powerpoint for the presentation on Feb 3rd.
We are happy to be done with this project because it has taught us a lot of things and made us better developers than we were at the beginning.
