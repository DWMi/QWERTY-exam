Sprint 1:
On this sprint we started to build on our mockup on figma, such as a design for all of our pages and our logo as well.
That took longer time than we expected but we managed to do it in aprox. 3 days.
After that we started to set up our repo on github and started to do our inital setup as well as the file structure in VSC.
As we were done with everything on the first sprint we decided to start a little bit on our components such as the header and the footer. And meanwhile that was done one of us started to look into the database in this case MongoDB and how it would work with an e-commerce if its even possible to do so. Which it was, so we also started to do some testing such as trying to push test products into our database and with sucess we ended the sprint.
